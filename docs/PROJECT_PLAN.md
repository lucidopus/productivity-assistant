# My Personal AI Assistant - Project Vision

## What I Want to Build
I want to create a personal AI assistant that helps me work more efficiently and stop falling behind on my goals. This AI will be like having a dedicated personal assistant who knows me deeply and helps me plan each day based on my bigger weekly targets. The assistant will live as a Slack bot that proactively talks to me every day.

## The Core Problem
I struggle with prioritizing tasks and often slack behind on my goals. I need someone (or something) that understands my life situation, remembers everything about me, and helps me make better daily decisions that align with my weekly ambitions.

## How It Will Work

### The AI's Knowledge About Me
The assistant needs to maintain a complete understanding of who I am:
- My background (for example: I'm from India, pursuing my Master's in the US)
- My current life situation and commitments
- My daily routines and preferences
- My typical energy levels throughout the day
- My past performance patterns - what I actually accomplish vs what I plan
- My ongoing responsibilities and deadlines

This knowledge should persist forever and grow over time as the AI learns more about me.

### The Weekly Planning Ritual
Every Sunday evening at 9 PM, the AI will reach out to me through Slack:
- It will ask: "Hey! Let's plan your week. What are your main goals for this week?"
- I'll tell it my targets in natural conversation (like "I have a MongoDB event on Tuesday and CS 556 homework due Friday that I want to finish early")
- The AI will understand these goals and create a realistic plan for the entire week

### Daily Planning and Accountability
Every weekday evening at 10 PM, the AI will:
- Check how my day went
- Look at what's left for the week
- Create a specific plan for tomorrow
- Send me the plan through Slack

The daily plans should be realistic and detailed, like:
```
Monday's Plan (Based on your weekly targets):
- 8:00 AM: Wake up and morning routine
- 9:00 AM: Start CS 556 homework - aim for problems 1-3
- 12:00 PM: Lunch break
- 1:30 PM: Continue homework, complete problem 3
- 3:00 PM: Review materials for Tuesday's MongoDB event
- 5:00 PM: Go for a walk
- 7:00 PM: Dinner and relaxation
- 9:00 PM: Light review for tomorrow's classes
- 10:00 PM: Check in with me about tomorrow
```

### Handling Real Life
The AI must be flexible:
- If something urgent comes up on Tuesday, it should automatically adjust Wednesday through Friday's plans
- If I'm falling behind, it should help me catch up realistically
- If I complete things faster than expected, it should help me get ahead
- It should learn from my actual performance to make better future plans

## The Experience I Want

### Natural Conversations
I want to talk to this AI like I would talk to a close friend or trusted assistant. It should:
- Remember our previous conversations
- Understand context without me having to explain everything
- Use a friendly, encouraging tone
- Feel like it genuinely cares about helping me succeed

### Proactive Support
The AI shouldn't wait for me to reach out. It should:
- Nudge me every Sunday to plan my week
- Message me every evening with tomorrow's plan
- Check in if I haven't updated it about important tasks
- Celebrate when I accomplish goals

### Platform Choice
This must be a Slack bot because:
- I use Slack daily already
- It can send me notifications at scheduled times
- I can quickly update it throughout the day
- The conversation history is naturally preserved

## What Success Looks Like
- I consistently achieve my weekly goals
- I feel less stressed about planning
- I stop forgetting important tasks
- I make steady progress on long-term objectives
- My days feel more purposeful and organized
- I have a clear plan every morning when I wake up

## Initial Setup Process
When I first start using the assistant:
1. I'll have a detailed conversation about my life, schedule, and goals
2. I'll share my typical daily patterns and energy levels
3. I'll explain my current commitments and responsibilities
4. The AI will use all this to create its initial understanding of me

## Growth Over Time
The assistant should become more helpful as it learns:
- Which types of plans I actually follow through on
- How long tasks really take me (vs my estimates)
- When I'm most productive for different types of work
- What kind of encouragement motivates me
- How to balance ambition with realistic expectations

## Essential Requirements
1. **Must be on Slack** - This is non-negotiable for the user experience I want
2. **Must remember everything** - No forgetting context between conversations
3. **Must be proactive** - Reaches out to me, not the other way around
4. **Must adapt** - Plans change based on reality, not rigid adherence
5. **Must feel personal** - Like it truly knows and understands me

## The Bigger Picture
This isn't just another task manager or calendar app. It's an AI that acts as my personal productivity partner - someone who knows my life situation, understands my goals, and actively helps me bridge the gap between what I want to achieve and what I actually do each day. It should feel less like using a tool and more like having a dedicated assistant who's always looking out for my success.
