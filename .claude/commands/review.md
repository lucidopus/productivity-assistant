Review the previous conversation history as well as the edits that are currently uncommitted into the $ARGUMENTS repository.  Taking the role of a senior engineering manager, review the code for best practices as well as adherence to our stated rules. Remember:
- Keep things simple
- Adhere to programming best practices
- Always try to reuse existing code to maximize modularity within reason
- Look for security flaws or risks
- Avoid fallbacks. Fail hard and throw errors instead so we can move forward cleanly.

Use your best judgment to apply a thorough code review and tell me what issues you see.
