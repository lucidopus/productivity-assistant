create a new task in /tasks/new/ to address this issue.  Make sure that it is detailed enough with sufficient context and relevant files, as well as what we know about the potential cause, if anything, to give a junior developer the best chance to pick up and solve this task independently. Do not to add deadlines or any weekly targets, the main purpose is to only focus on the task itself.
